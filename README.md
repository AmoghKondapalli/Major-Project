# LSTM IDS Pipeline
- Developed a self-contained Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging a powerful LSTM model trained on the industry-standard CICIDS dataset.
- The solution delivers real-time threat detection for live network traffic analysis, ensuring immediate response to potential security breaches.
- Designed for maximum portability, the system is deployable on any Linux system, simplifying integration into existing network infrastructure.
